  <h2>JavaScript?</h2>
  <p>
    JavaScript (/ˈdʒɑːvəˌskrɪpt/),[9] often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification.
    JavaScript is high-level, often just-in-time compiled, and multi-paradigm. It has curly-bracket syntax, dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions.
    Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web.
    Over 97% of websites use it client-side for web page behavior, often incorporating third-party libraries.
    Most web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on the user's device.
